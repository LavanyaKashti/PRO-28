Dal Dhokli is a spicy, sweet, one-pot meal, prepared by simmering whole wheat flour bits in a lentil-based motley perked with spices. It is a popular dish in Gujarat and Rajasthan and is prepared mostly for lunch. Here is how to make it in a traditional Gujarati style.

 
Dal Dhokli served in bowls.


One of the closest friends of my mom is a Gujarati. As much as they shared their comradeship, they even exchanged many Gujarati recipes.

And I being a foodie, loved trying umpteen Gujarati dishes that my mom made after learning from her friend.

Right from Gujarati Bajre ki Raab, Gujarati Kadhi, Gujarati Fajeto, Gujarati Khandvi, my mom made them all and we enjoyed feasting on them like anything.  

Gujarati Moong Dal Dhokla to date continues to be my favorite and I prepare it every once in awhile for breakfast but guess what, amongst all of those Gujarati dishes, Dal Dhokli Recipe still remains completely unbeatable.

While my kid calls it a Gujarati Soup, I personally think that it is one of the tastiest “soup” that you would ever savor!
